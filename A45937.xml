            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OU are carefully to Read the Act of Parliament made in the Seventh and Eighth Year of His Majesties Reign, for Granting to His Majesty certain Rates and Duties upon Houses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Also another Act in the Sixth and Seventh Year of His Majesties Reign for Granting to His Majesty certain Duties upon Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, Births, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Abstract thereof. As also one other Act made the Seventh and Eighth Year of His Majesties Reign for Enforcing the Laws which Restrain Marriages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And one other Act made the last Session of Parliament for making Good the Deficiency of several Funds therein mentioned, from <hi>Pag.</hi> 322. to 328. to the end you may fully inform your self of the Nature of the Duties for which you are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Surveyor, how the same ought to be Rated, Charged and Paid, and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions Rectified, and His Majesty not Defrauded of any part of the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You are forthwith to repair to the County for which you are appointed Surveyor, and there Consult with the Receiver General of the Taxes, where to begin, and how to proceed in making the Survey of all Dwelling-Houses within the said County (Except Cottages and Houses already Rated Ten Shillings) and to Enter fairly in the Books herewith delivered you, Copies of the Assessments already made by the Assessors, expressing in the first Colum for that Purpose the Number of Windows in each House contained in such Assessment, and in the next Colum the Number of Windows which you shall find in every such House upon your Survey, where the same shall differ from what are already Charged, and in the extream Colum for that purpose, the Charge or Sum of Money already Rated or to be Rated upon every House.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You are to take Care that no House, in any Village or Place within the County for which you are appointed, liable to be Rated by Virtue of the said Act, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape such Taxation, nor that any House Assessed be continued to be Rated at a less Sum than is directed by the said Act for Granting the said Duty upon Houses.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Where any House shall have been omitted, you are to Enter in your Book the Parish and Place, the Name of the Person Inhabiting such House, as also the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Windows (not exceeding Twenty) in the same, and Rate such House accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to such Number of Windows as is directed by the said Act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> After you have made and regularly entred the Assessments and Survey of the County for which you are appointed, you are to cast up the Books of the same, and send us an Account of the Total Charge of each Parish, distinguishing in one Colum what was the Charge upon the former Assessment, and in another the Charge by your Survey.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> You are carefully to inspect the Registers of Marriages, Births and Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, and of Christenings in every Parish or Place within the County for which you are appointed, as aforesaid, and to observe whether such Registers are kept accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Acts of Parliament, and to take such Extracts or Copies of the same from time to time, as may Enable you to know the Sum of Money that ought to be paid by the Collectors of every Parish to the Receiver General for the said Duties, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49050:2"/>to use all possible means to Discover whether Persons liable to the Payment of the same, are Rated for their Qualities according to the Act. And likewise to make particular Enquiry concerning Batchelors and Widowers, and their Qualities, that they also (who generally have hitherto Escaped) may be Taxed, as by the said Act is appointed, and so in case of the Removal of such Person, as by the said Act, <hi>Pag.</hi> 307.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> You are to take especial Care that upon the Burial of any Person who was Relieved where he Inhabited, by Virtue of any Act of Parliament for Relief of the Poor, that the Duty for such Burial be paid by the Church Wardens, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Direction of the Act, <hi>Pag.</hi> 313. &amp; 314.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> You are to take Care that all Quakers, Papists or reputed Papists, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be Charged for and do Pay the Duties Imposed by the said Act, and give Notice of their Marriages, and that the Penalty be Levied as by the said Act. <hi>Pag.</hi> 325.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> You are to take Care that Notice of the Birth of every Child be given according to the Direction of another Act for Enforcing the Laws concerning Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, <hi>&amp;c. Pag.</hi> 737 &amp; 738, and that Notice be given of Persons Buried in other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes than where they Resided, according to the Act last mentioned. <hi>Pag.</hi> 738 &amp; 739.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenthly,</hi> You are also from the Registers, as aforesaid, or otherwise to Enable your self, to send us when the same shall be Required, an Account of the Total Sum of Money Charged, Due or Payable in each Parish within your Survey, for or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Marriages, Births, Burials, Batchelors and Widowers, and their respective Qualities as Rateable by the said Act.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventhly,</hi> In all Cases of Assessments where Houses have been under Rated, or are omitted, you are to Apply to the Justices of the Peace Acting in the Division where such Under Assessment or Omission shall happen to be, (unless the Assessors will of themselves Amend their Assessment) that such Rates may be set upon every Person and Premisses as are according to the said Act for Granting the Duty on Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: And so in all Cases where the Collectors of the Duties upon Marriages, Births and Burials, and upon Batchelors and Widowers, shall neglect or refuse to Charge and Demand the Duties Payable in respect of any Quality, or otherwise for the same, you are also to Acquaint the Justices of the Peace, as aforesaid, as also the Receiver General of the County; whom you are to Consult upon all Difficulties, that such Methods may be taken for His Majesties Service as are according to the several Acts of Parliament for Granting and Ascertaining the Duties aforesaid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> If any Collector or Assessor shall neglect or refuse to Admit you to take Copy or Copies, or Extracts of the Assessments, as aforesaid, or any Constable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall refuse to Assist you in making the Survey of Windows for the Duty on Houses, or other Person refuse upon reasonable Demand to shew you the Register, or to take Extracts or Copies of such Register, according to the Direction of the late Act of Parliament, you are also to Apply to the next Justice of Peace, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to Acquaint us therewith, that such Methods may be taken as are according to Law, and to Acquaint us also if any Justice of Peace shall neglect or Refuse to do his Duty, according to the Act of Parliament in that behalf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> You are to demean your self in the Execution hereof, and in every Part of your Duty as may give no Just Occasion of Complaint, and in all things to Govern your self by the several Acts of Parliament, and Acquaint us with your Proceedings from time to time.</p>
